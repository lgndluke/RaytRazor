Star Destoyer (from Star Wars, The Empire Srikes Back, and Return of the Jedi) for Poser 4 (PC/ Mac)
by John Hoagland

created on: 10/16/2004

Directions:
Extract the files into the specified folders:
Put the obj file into Runtime\Geometries\JHoagland
Put the pp2/ rsr (prop files) into Runtime\Libraries\Props\JHoagland
--The "StarDestoyer_template.gif" is not used on the model, but is included in case you want to build your own textures.

Using the prop:
1) Start Poser.
2) Go to the Props > JHoagland Library.
3) Add the Star Destroyer to your scene.
Notes:
1) The Star Destroyer will seem big and may fill the scene. This is normal- although it is *NOT* scaled to the size of the Poser figures, it is still a large ship.
